"A Selective Undo Mechanism for Graphical User Interfaces Based On Command Objects"
by Thomas Berlage makes a good case for 'direct selective undo' (what I implemented)
rather than "script-based" selective undo.

We will use the 'opposite' property description metamodel property to indicate
that relationship integrity maintainence should be performed.
