Typewriter TODO
===============

- [ ] Maybe commit text changes when the user manually moves the insertion point, to try to avoid "... and other edits" commits
- [x] Don't create Default Tag Group
- [ ] Delete' is enabled in the menus for All Notes
- [ ] if not tag group exists, new tags you create remain invisible (and the button and menu actions are not disabled)â€¦ I guess the solution is to create a New Tag Group at the same time, if there is none.
- [ ] name a new tag group just Untitled Tag Group X
- [ ] a new tag could be named Untitled X
- [ ] a way to give a name to a checkpoint
- [ ] some way to see the list of all the checkpoints
- [ ] have Revert show a panel listing all the checkpoints, so you can pick the one you want
- [ ] "Checkpoint" opens a standard Mac save dialog (OS X 10.7)
- [ ] NSDocument stack trace from Quentin
