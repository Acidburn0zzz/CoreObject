This is an attempt to write a demonstration of a project UI with all of the
neat things we want:

 - revision control / checkpointing / branching / merging / selective undo
 - collaborative editing

It uses my CoreObject rewrite as its persistence layer.

The library is saved in ~/ProjectDemoStore

What's working:

-the "Newâ€¦" menu item, and "New Outline" button
-Insert, Insert Child, Step Backward, Step Forward toolbar items in an outline window
-editing the label of an outline item
-drag and drop of outline items, including between documents
-Document -> Move to trash (no way to view the trash, but the persistent root is deleted, and the document won't re-open on the next app launch)
- The undo mode in Preferences
- "Undo", "Redo", "Step Backward", "Step Forward" in the "Edit" menu

Probably nothing else works, but it's enough to be a useful demo
