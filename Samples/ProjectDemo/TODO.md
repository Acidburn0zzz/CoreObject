###General

 - Re-enable tagging UI

    - add selective undo buttons to history graph window
    - show username in history graph when sharing
 - Investiage "changes in both contexts" exceptions that happen during undo/redo (not sure if they still happen)
 - diff/merge visualizations (even very basic, like displaying the output of the -description method in a text view)
 - make branch switch undoable
 - attachments over XMPP
 - rename the branch UI to sharing Sessions 
 - ProjectDemo should support restarting sharing on a document thatâ€™s been shared
 - Add pause / resume methods for sharing
