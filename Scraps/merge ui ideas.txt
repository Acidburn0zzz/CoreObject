- diff/merge API and code
  - Improve Merging (move detection and custom attributed string merger)
  - Need to support persisted partial merge resolutions.
    - Thought about this a bit. I don't think we can provide it in general in the framework,
      apps will have to implement support for it.
      
      Some apps may want to open a temporary persistent root, with its own
      metamodel for managing the merge, others may want to do it only in memory.
      
      Also, though the diff/merge happens at the persistent root granularity,
      there may be multiple inner object trees with different merge UI's.
      (e.g. several types of objects on a canvas in a composite documents)
  - Build an example app with a merging UI
  - Requirements:
    - We will highlight the area where a conflict appeared. It will show the automatic
	 result, and let the user make a manual edit
    - allow both collapsed (like SourceTree) and expanded (like Xcode) diff view
