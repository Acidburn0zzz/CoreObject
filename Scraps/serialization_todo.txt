BTW, on a related note, I agree with this comment in COSerialization:

// TODO: A bit ugly, would be better to add new entity descriptions
// such as NSBOOLNumber, NSCGFloatNumber etc.

What I would like to do is have a section in COSerialization.h or COObject.h like this:

// Basic types

extern NSString const * COEntityNameBool;
extern NSString const * COEntityNameInt64;
extern NSString const * COEntityNameDouble;
extern NSString const * COEntityNameAttachmentID;
extern NSString const * COEntityNameString;
extern NSString const * COEntityNameBlob;

// Convenience types, which are automatically translated to a basic type

extern NSString const * COEntityNameNSRect;
extern NSString const * COEntityNameNSSize;
etc.

â€¦as well as very clear documentation that if you call aPropertyDesc.persistent = YES;, one of the following must be true:

- the type is one of those listed above
- or the type is a descendent of COObject
- or the persistentType is set to one of the types listed above, and a value transformer name is set

otherwise an exception is thrown. Does that sound reasonable?
