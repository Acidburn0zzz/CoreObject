Bad Ideas
===========

Design ideas which seem appealing or reasonable but are dead ends for some reason.

Q: Can we avoid storing 'tip' by just looking for the newest non-hidden
commit on a branch? looks like yes... But actually no, because we can e.g.
set the tip to be the end of an anonymous branch without comitting to it.



Meta-History (History of history operations, i.e. undo/redo)
------------------------------------------------------------

Question: Should changes to the mutable part of the store be attached to a commit?
i.e. the commit metadata? Do we want "undo" or "redo" or "change branch" to show up 
in the history log?

A: It seems sensible,.. but if you consider the history log with a branch graph view,
it makes it clear that these are meta-operations. Do we want/need "meta-history"?
It's probably unnecessary and a lot of complexity to implement.

Emacs' undo system provides this but it's kind of a pain; it's only advantage
in emacs is to make up for not properly modeling branching undo.
