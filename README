Key Features:

- Revision Control	

	- Based on Object Graph Diff and Merging Model
		- Each Change is a delta represented as an Object Graph Patch
	- Two-level History
		- History Graph per document
		- Undo Track per activity
	- Branch
	- Cheap Copy (a document copy consumes no space)
	- Pervasive Undo/Redo
		- Document Changes (Creation, Update and Deletion inside a Document)
		- Store Changes (Document/Branch Creation, Update and Deletion)
	- Selective Undo (each change can be cancelled individually)
	- Persistent Undo Stacks
		- Mutiple Undo Views on the same document
		- Undo Stack Union View
	- Localizable History
	- History Compression and Compaction
	- Serialization Formats
		- JSON and Binary 
		- Stable over multiple invocations for the same object graph
		

- Object Store

	- Pragmatic OODB atop SQLite
	- Minimalistic Metamodel
	- Flexible Storage Model 
		- Coarse-grained Objects with Metadata (e.g. Documents and their Branches)
		- Fine-grained Objects (e.g. inside Document Branches)
		- Optional Object Organization Model based on Tags and Libraries
		- Built-in Indexing and Search (history included)
	- Flexible Collection and Relationship Model
		- Unidirectional or bidirectional
			- Ordered or unordered
			- To-one or to-many
			- Composite
		- Undirectional Unordered Keyed
		- Transparent Constraint Enforcements on Update
	- Cross Document References
		- named branch
		- current branch
		- unidirectional accross arbitrary branch
		- bidirectional between the current branches
	- Synthesized Accessors
	- Transparent Object Graph Copy
	- Transient Object Graph

- Real-Time Collaboration

	- Any CoreObject-based model supports it (for free)
	- Based on the Revision Control Model
	- Very Fast
	- Full Branch and Undo Support per User
		- Per User Persistent Undo Stack
		- Per User Selective Undo
	- Based on XMPP

- Overall Design

	- Small Code Base (~ 20 000 loc)
	- Pretty Large Test suite (over 2300 tests)
	- High Quality API documentation
	- Minimal dependencies (SQLite and EtoileFoundation)
	- Pervasive UUID use (no string, number or content-based identifiers)
	- Favor JSON formats
	- Create a Persistent Object and save it in 4 loc

		COStore *store = [[COSQLiteStore alloc] initWithURL: [NSURL fileURLWithPath: @"TestStore.db"]];
		COEditingContext *ctx = [COEditingContext contextWithStore: store];
		COObject *persistentObject = [[ctx insertNewPersistentRootWithEntityName: @"COObject"] rootObject];
		[[persistentObject persistentRoot] commit];


Build and Install
-----------------

Read INSTALL.Cocoa or INSTALL.GNUstep documents.


Mac OS X support
----------------

CoreObject is supported on Mac OS X (10.7 or higher) and iOS.

An Xcode project is bundled to build CoreObject on Mac OS X. 

Another Xcode project to build the CoreObject demo application can be found in Samples/ProjectDemo.

**Warning:** Xcode 4.6 or higher is required to build these projects.
